Google Go Maps
---------------------------

Google Go Maps uses Google static maps API to query maps and "map" them to unity world.
This asset makes it easy to convert map positions to unity world positions and vice versa.

Drawing a map in Unity
---------------------------
1 - Assign GoogleStaticMap.cs to a quad (can be other types of object)
2 - Assign the map material from the GoogleGoMap/materials folder to the object.

3 - From a separate script and the from GoogleStaticMap component of the quad, call:
	a) call initialize()
	b) Set the centerMercator (i.e. center of the map) to tileCenterMercator (GeoPoint(lat,lon));
	c) call DrawMap(). 


In addition to drawing a map, Google Go Maps, helps you to track a character and load the map accordingly
The best way to learn how to use this feature is loading the example scene. 
While running on a mobile device, the GPS location of the user will be used to load the map,
While running on the editor, a hardcoded lat/lon location in Los Angeles, CA is used. 

In the demo scene, I implemented a tiled mapping system which lets the player to
move on the map. A few cubic objects are also positioned on the map to help you understand how
you can put objects on the map according to their (lat,lon).

There are several options to customize the Google map. Note that some options may not work,
as there might be on going issues with Google’s static maps. For example, as the time of writing
this guide, the road strokes does not work properly.

Quick guide about the example scene:
The game is managed by the GameManger.cs script attached to an object with the same name.
This script is Singleton, so you can access it from anywhere. 
In this script, we first start the location services for the player (if available) and wait
for a response. If the service is available, the GPS location of the phone will be used. If 
not, a hardcoded value is passed along. The map is initialized. Then it’s center is set.
To best understand the codes, you need to know how Web Mercator mapping work. But you can 
also learn by reading the example carefully. In short, Web Mercator is a function with 
maps the earth surface a map as seen in Google map, or most of other web map services. There
is one-to-one correspondence between (lat, lon) on the earth surface and (x,y) in the Web Mercator
system. There are functions provided for you to do this conversion, so you don’t need to worry!

There are two quads name map-1 and map-2. These quads alternatively load the map and show it while
the character (the capsule) moves.
